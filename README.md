# Covid19 detection from CT scan images
The information obtained by using CT images is important for clinical diagnoses. It is required to design an image analysis scheme for the detection of viral epidemics using CT scan images. This work used chest CT scan images in the diagnosis of COVID-19 using deep learning models.  Four models namely COVID-DNet, COVID-RNet, COVID-CapsNet, and COVID-3DCNN are designed to diagnose Covid-19 patients. 
Four filed are availabl here to implement Capsule network, Transfer learning using densenet and resnet, and 3D CNN are given. The image data is available at
