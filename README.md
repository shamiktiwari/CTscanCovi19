# Covid19 detection from CT scan images
The information obtained by using CT images is crucial for clinical diagnoses. Therefore, it is required to design an image analysis scheme for the detection of viral epidemics using CT scan images. This paper aims to examine the utility of chest CT scan images in the diagnosis of COVID-19 using deep learning models.  Four models namely COVID-DNet, COVID-RNet, COVID-CapsNet, and COVID-3DCNN are designed in this work to diagnose Covid-19 patients. From the experimental results, it is found that all the models are providing effective accuracy among which the COVID-DNet model has reached the highest accuracy.
